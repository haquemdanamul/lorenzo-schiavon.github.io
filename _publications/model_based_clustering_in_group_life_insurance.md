Abstract: Experience rating allows insurance companies to adjust the premium fora certain policyholder on the basis of the loss experienced by similar insured par-ties. In group life insurance, because of the lack of complete information, clusteringpolicyholders is particularly challenging. To address this issue we adopt a model-based clustering approach using flexible Bayesian nonparametric mixtures, whichtake into account the discrete nature of data, consisting of claim counts. We considera Pitman-Yor mixture of Rounded Gaussian kernels, which provides more flexibleand robust results than standard Poisson mixtures. We show how this approach leadsto more accurate inference compared to standard Dirichlet process mixtures of Pois-son, through an application to data arising from a portfolio of groups of workers.
