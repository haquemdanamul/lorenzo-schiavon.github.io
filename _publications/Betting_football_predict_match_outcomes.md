Abstract: In the context of sports betting, estimates of probabilities related to specific events in a football match are quantities of deep interest. Starting from appropriate marginal and conditional distributions, a joint distribution is introduced in
order to model the dependence between the number of goals scored by the two opposing teams. This model allows to obtain estimates of probabilities for all the possible match outcomes and, in so doing, to develop a betting strategy. An application is presented in this paper: it shows encouraging results and highlights satisfactory return in the long run.
